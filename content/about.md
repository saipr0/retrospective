## As an Engineer

I spend most of my time learning, motivated both by the feeling that I always have more to understand and by a natural curiosity about science and the world around me.
And when I pick up some project - it almost always becomes an addiction.

### why the term addiction?

Because its deteriorating to my health, it's tough to balance things out, when you are immersed onto something and you want to see how it will turn out.

### I am not a 10x or 100x Developer

I enjoy solving problems that have a real-world connection. I’m not someone who can quickly type out code and produce bug-free programs, but I won’t move forward on any project until I truly understand it.
