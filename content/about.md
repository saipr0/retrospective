## Colophon

Inspired by
<a href="https://stephango.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steph Ango&#xf46c;</a>
, loving the simplicity, I created a similar website. I can write my notes in simple markdown and have them converted to html, for that I am using
<a href="https://github.com/markedjs/marked" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marked&#xf46c;</a>
and for the pretty code blocks its
<a href="https://prismjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prismjs&#xf46c;</a> .

And this is hosted from
<a href="https://github.com/saipr0/retrospective" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my github repo&#xf46c;</a>
 where i can easily track my changes.
