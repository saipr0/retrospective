I'm Sai. A 2025 graduate. I'm currently working at my first company
[Tag-N-Trac&#xf46c;](https://tagntrac.ai/) .

## Colophon

Inspired by
[Steph Ango&#xf46c;](https://stephango.com/)
, loving the simplicity, I created a similar website. I can write my notes in simple markdown and have them converted to html, for that I am using
[marked&#xf46c;](https://github.com/markedjs/marked)
and for the pretty code blocks its
[prismjs&#xf46c;](https://prismjs.com/) .

And this is hosted from
[my github repo&#xf46c;](https://github.com/saipr0/retrospective)
 where i can easily track my changes.
