I am addicted to building things that have a certain beauty to them. By addiction i mean its detoriating to my health - it's tough to balance things out, when you are immersed onto something that you wanna see on how it turns out.

That's my approach to the projects. I wanna build every project that i truly would be happy using it, finding that it provides a new insight, a new perspective.
